      <p>
      Hi there! Welcome on my personal page.
      </p>
      <p>
      I invite you to join me on my journey to understand what it's all about. 
      Following this path I will try to stay open to new ideas and perspectives and humble in making opinions, but yes... making opinions, as without them the journey is just watching the track through binoculars, without taking any step.
      I will be sharing here my projects, thoughts and whatever comes to my mind.
      </p>
