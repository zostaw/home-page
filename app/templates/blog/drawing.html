      <h1 style="font-size: 25px; text-align: center;">Drawing</h1>
<p>I seek to learn digital drawing. My first attempt a couple of years ago failed badly when I bought my iPad. At that time I thought it is impossible for me to learn it, it is just too much generalisation and it requires from one to have a good eye for patterns, that I thought I do not possess.</p>

<p>And yet here I am!</p>

<p>This post is for me a reiteration of understanding, externalisation of the observations I made. It is a great exercise to write down and even better to speak to someone of what we learned and observed in order to make it memorable. Otherwise all is gone in a matter of days.</p>

<p>When I first started watching tutorials I found there are two main approaches: </p>

<ul>
	<li>abstract - generalisation and big shapes, then shading also in shapes to add the nuances and details; this one deals with big abstract patterns that are use to make the objects illusion of having details; </li>
	<li>creating basic outline of the object, then adding some lights and shades and then sculpting the details from the sources of lights/shades</li>
</ul>

<p>The latter one is more natural to me, I tend to think of myself as more of a detail-oriented and I often over focus on them. So I&#39;m more captivated by the former approach, I want to learn in not only for drawing in itself, but I feel like this is going to cause a massive impact on other areas of my life. I think like the detail orientation is great when we want the meaning of things, some deep truth, but for telling a story it is better to paint the big shapes and trick the mind, seed an illusion of some truths to make it more alluring.</p>

<p>One of the greatest things about this approach is that you really start big and ignore all the details, you use the big strokes to create an illusion of matter. It is almost overwhelming, because one needs to decide on what&#39;s the most important to put in the picture first and what to ignore. The main focus is to prepare the composition, the direction of the picture, find the darkest and the lightest elements, think on which shapes to put on the canvas and which he should omit and disregard. One needs to be very careful not to get into too much shaping. It teaches him a discipline and planning.</p>

<p>When I watch tutorials on youtube it is almost like dark magic to me, it feels too good to be true! You can put the big shapes and then only slowly add the smaller shapes and eventually you get to the details level. And when you listen to the commentary, don&#39;t blink or you&#39;ll miss the transition between one big shape and fully finished picture. All the changes are progressive and there&#39;s no single moment where it&#39;s supposed to take shape, it is slow progressions of all the elements on the picture. Personally I find it difficult to organise in my head, I need to know what is it that I should be drawing, adding just portion of thing - it feels overwhelming - what is the portion that you&#39;re supposed to do.<br/>I think that&#39;s where the abstraction comes. You must look (or imagine) what are the main features of the thing and try to label it. For example what is a mountain:</p>

<ul>
	<li>it has a shape - it can be a block or it can be a long hill</li>
	<li>it has a structure, texture - multiple blocks, it is rough, it does not reflect good</li>
	<li>it has variety of curves</li>
</ul>

<p>Now each of the features tells something about the approach:</p>

<ul>
	<li>shape helps to create the outline and inner lines of the block</li>
	<li>structure and texture help to define the type of brush, size of strokes</li>
	<li>the curves define the changes between different parts of the block, they help to create the overall shape of it with the help of shading</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, those are the basic concepts of the technical approach, there are in fact many more aspects of the painting that are far more important than technique, especially in this abstract approach. One of the most important is the composition of the drawing. We need to decide how do we want to direct the eye of the person who looks at the piece. If there are too many scattered objects and the drawing does not have clear direction, it can be overwhelming and exhausting to the eye. Instead if we guide the eye into a point, the compositions starts to make sense and helps to tell the story.</p>

<p>Another thing to consider in building a great composition is the size of elements and the quality of the details. One obvious answer is the size of object - the closer they are, the bigger they should be. But there are more:</p>

<ul>
	<li>perspective drawing - it's a technique used to depict the spacial depth. As mentioned above - the elements appear smaller the farther they are in a distance. That seems obvious when we think of object that is very far away, but what about objects that are both here and there? Are they both big and small? Yes! And the perspective drawing helps us to depict this amazing effect. The simplest way to understand it is to imagine a point on a horizon line as a reference point for all objects, let's call this point - vanishing point. Depending on the rotation of the object, the vanishing point can move to the left or right, but it will always stay on the line. Objects that are rotated at the same direction (for example row of buildings) will have the same vanishing point. Once we define the direction of an object, all is left to do is to guide lines towards the vanishing point. An object can have 2 or even 3 vanishing points if it is relatively close to the observer. An excellent example that shows it could be a line of buildings in a city. For example, on the following picture all buildings are turned in the same direction, hence they all have the same vanishing point; the banks of the river and the edges of the buildings - they are all guided towards one point in the middle.</li>
	<img src="static/images/perspective.jpg" style="max-height: 80vh;">
	<li>not all the terrain is visible to the eye - most of the time when we look to a distance there are hills behind hills - that means some of the objects in a distance will be only partially seen, but another important consequence is that we can and should consider each hill as a separate set. Just imagine, the hills are separated from each other by hundreds of meters or maybe kilometres, that means the objects on the further hills will be so much smaller!</li>
	<li>elements of the terrain are often similar in different scenarios and they can be used for our advantage - for example lower parts of trees in the big sceneries are almost always accompanied (if not hidden behind) bushes, use it!</li>
	<li>atmospheric perspective - it indicates that as an object recedes into the distance relative to the viewer, we see that object with reduced clarity, value and colour saturation. That means when we draw parts of the picture that are far in a distance, they should be dimmed, their value and contrast should be low. The closer the objects - the more clear they should be, they should also have more details.</li>
</ul>

<p>That is all I learned this time. There is much more I don&#39;t know and even with all that knowledge there is this huge gap between what I just learned and my ability to use it in practice. What I found fascinating when watching artists that make these great tutorials and commentaries is that it looks simple and obvious when they say that, but then I put a single stroke on my canvas and it&#39;s wrong. I appreciate these moments of grounding! It takes a lot of time to master something and then explain the process in simple terms, I take this day as a lesson on humility, but also appreciation for the great humans that share their amazing skills and knowledge with us - the apprentices.</p>
