      <h1 style="font-size: 25px; text-align: center;">Dionysiac Architects reference in Assassin's Creed</h1>

<p>
  While reading "The Secret Teachings of all Ages" I came across a chapter about Freemasonic symbolism, where Manly P. Hall talks about the great Dionysiac Architects who were involved in building some of the greatest monuments in our history. They based their craft on perfect proportions, an idea that came from Vitruvius, and left carved marks and symbols on surfaces. These were mostly compasses, squares, rulers, and other Pythagorean symbols. The Architects also communicated with other members of the guild by using peculiar code and terminology that was derived from elements of architecture.
</p>
<p>
  It immediately reminded me of a game I played when I was young. Assassin's Creed ends with a mystery. The player is guided into the basements of a chapel (maybe St. Peter's?) where there is a lot of symbolism on the walls. The player is left with the impression that there is a secret society that leads the church in this game, and that the plot and storyline that we engage with as a "killing machine paid with money and reputation" is part of a bigger whole - as a player we are a puppet in the hands of real players. One takes a few steps and notices doors. A member of this group, covered with cardinal's clothes, steps outside. It was a long time ago, but I think he said something in Latin and left or disappeared, and you definitely don't get to interact with him, which leaves you with even more craving to know what the secret is, what it's all about. You enter an inner hall with even more symbols and you're left in this place with confusion and an unsatisfied spirit, because it feels like there's some kind of message to be learned, but then the game ends...
</p>
<p>
  I cannot stop thinking that it might be some kind of reference to Masons or Rosicrucians. It is fascinating. There are a lot of missions that happen inside the chapel where you get to see scaffoldings and you climb up over them to jump close to the unfinished roof and the art painted on the ceilings. It was being built right there next to the player. Could those be Dionysiac Architects? What is the meaning in the context of the game within and out - the stories, experiences of the assassin on the missions and the game as a whole?
</p>
<p>
  There was one more interesting thing in this last scene with symbolism. It looked like the messages were both in the game and outside of it. A puzzle, put out by the creators, that the game was just part of. Were they trying to say something? Were they part of a secret society? Or perhaps they were just deeply inspired by the secret societies?
</p>
<p>
  The "creator" of a brilliantly designed game has the same connotation as the "architect" of a perfectly designed chapel. Did they feel a deep connection with the crafts of Dionysiac Architects? Was it a discovery? A tribute?
</p>
<p>
  We might never know why the ending was so mysterious, but perhaps that's the essence of great creations - that they leave us with a sense of wonder and spiritual dissatisfaction, yearning to uncover the masqueraded secrets, because life is one of them and they provide us with meaning.
