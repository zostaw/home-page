      <h1 style="font-size: 25px; text-align: center;">Childhood aspirations</h1>


      <p>
      I am a 29 year old fellow who wanted to become an astronaut or a physicist. SPOILER... I am neither :)
      I do not remember my childhood or adolescence well, but I remember I was always fascinated by stories and the greatness of humanity: all the amazing projects and achievements we made and most of all - the creativity of the human mind in searching for truth.
      When I was a child I was obsessed with logic and imagination... and human mind. All the things that make us tick. But only from a distance as I was straining from the interactions with other beings. I thought I was always saying wrong things, accidently offending people. Now I don't think that way, I think I'm learning :)

      The books and movies always played a big role in my life.
      For the movies - they provided me with motivation to act, to try difficult things. Apollo 13 inspired me to get good at math. My dad told me that to become an astronaut I must calculate fast as calculator in my mind, I must be sharp... I've never been very sharp, but I calculated pretty fast when I was in highschool.
      The books inspired me to think and imagine.
      I was always looking through all sorts of atlases, dictionaries and popular-science books that I found in my parents' library or received on my birthday. One of the most important were surely ones that dealt with paradoxes in physics, such as Shrodinger's Cat and theory of relativity. I did not understand them back then and I still don't, but I thought it is nice to imagine things that are impossible, there is something that makes the mind to seek for the patterns, to try to make sense out of them and the paradoxes are clearly ones that influence those processes the most.
      I'm coming from a very religious family, my parents were taking us to celebrate the Great Week in a Franciscans' monastery, every year. The road was very long and uncomfortable and there were a lot of praying involved, but I really enjoyed the mysthical vibes of the ceremonies, especially Great Friday and Saturday: the moments of revealing the cross or the entrance of the major priest when all is dark and the church is slowly feeling with light step by step and priest is shouting "light of Christ"... and all the people in this place are focused on one thing, everybody is consumed by the emotions of the one spark of light that slowly conquers the darkness. </br>
      When I was a teenager I struggled to understand the religion - what exactly it is. There were all these mysthical aspects of the bible: the stories of foresight, the miracles, but probably the most mysthical of all - the connection of human beings over the generations and the common humanity. This I still do not understand - how come this... thing connected human beings so powerfully that now we cannot imagine a human society (or human mind) free of religious thought. And then on the other side there's all those elements that came after I started reading the bible. I was absolutely amazed by the first books - the imagination, the visions... but I could not understand it. I thought the Satan is the good guy. The Creator limited the humans so that they stay simple, barely conscious, but the Satan - he gave humans the ability to see and reason. I could not understand how come he was portrayed as the bad guy, or evil. In the same books it stated that God is omnipresent and timeless, I wanted to understand this concept, so I asked my dad how come the God was always there, even before the creation. He responded "this is incomprehensible for human beings". I could not leave it as that. How come it is incomprehensible?! We imagined the ability to be above time, then we must understand it, we must be able to comprehend it!
      </br>
      And so there were two forces that were pulling me opposite sides: on one side there was this great mystery of the religion that made the humans somehow connected, on the other hand there were all those "statements" that just did not make sense, they were too... simplistic, naive. And from that moment I knew that there are amazing truths in the bible, but they are not of literal nature. It is the patterns, or symbols which were imagined that are the essence, and not what they are told to represent - one being closer to reality, the other an expression of dogma.

      <p>
      I invite you to join me on my journey to understand what it's all about.
      In this pursuit I will try to stay open to new ideas and perspectives and humble in making opinions, but yes... making opinions, as without them the journey is just like reading a map without taking a single step towards adventure and exploration.
      I will be sharing my projects, thoughts, understanding or reflections on books I read and... whatever comes to my mind.
      </p>
